crename - Custom Rename CLI v2.0.0 (c) M.Gro√ü

Help Page for the --default Command:

Usage:
crename --default Arg

The Default Command takes in 1 Argument that specifies the Base Name Scheme for the renaming.
Then it looks for the first Numbers it can find and uses those to complete the Naming.
If no Argument is provided the Command defaults to the String "Chapter ". (mind the whitespace)

Note: This Command ignores Files and only renames Folders.
If u want Whitespace between the Base Name and the Number it must be included in the Argument

Examples:
crename 
crename -d Folder 
crename --default "Test "
